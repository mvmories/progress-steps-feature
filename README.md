# progress-steps-feature

2/50: 
This is the second of fifty projects, that i will be doing in the next 50 days.
The idea is to use html, css and vanilla javascript to improve my skills.

In this project I created 4 different circles, in which each cirle represents a step in a process (normally used to inform the users visually of how many steps are involved in a specific activity they are doing - like for example, registring their account).  

When a step is active, its specific step number gets a blue colored-border, and the progress bar grows accordingly, with the same color. 

To update the number of steps we can use a "prev" or "next" button.
The "prev" button gets disabled when we are in the first step, and the "next" button gets disabled when we reach the last one.

Hope you enjoy!
